# Bootcamp Home Session 1 - Modelling OOP for a real world problem (Meals)

This repo holds a solution that defines two classes. A meal superclass, and a Nigerian Meal sublcass. It goes on to show OOP concepts like Polymorphism,
Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

## Getting Started

To use this solution:

 - Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and [Navigate](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855) to folder you want to keep working copy of repo.

 - Clone this repository: 

     run from your git terminal-
  ```https://github.com/OsayamenOsaretin/abv_bc_session1/blob/function-findMinMax/README.md``` 

 

- In your working directory, install dependencies by running:

                           ```npm install```

 

### Prerequisites
You need these installed if you want the sweet awesomeness of an A.P and G.P checker

- [Git](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) 
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)



### Installing
After collecting and installing the prerequisites:
- 

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```


## Running the tests

To the run the tests:

``` npm test```

### Break down of what tests test

Tests were designed to show OOP concepts

```
It should return and modify the class attributes using getter and setter attributes (encapsulation)

It should show Inheritance by proving the sublcass inherits attributes and methods from the super class.

It should show Polymorphism by having a subclass behave like the superclass.

```
